### Testing User Stories
#### User Goals
- **To check the current weather of a location / city.**
  - The app prompts the user to enter the name of any geographical location / city to display the current weather condition. 
  - The app then presents the data back to the user, fulfilling the requirements of this user goal.

- **To check the next 5 days weather forecast for any geographical location/ city.**

  - The user is prompted to enter the name of any geographical location / city to display the forecast weather for next 5 days. 
  - The user is then presented with the 5 days forecasts weather, achieving the objective of this goal.

- **To see the weather condition comparison result of 2 different locations/ cities.**

  - The user is prompted to enter the names of any geographical locations / cities to display the weather condition with a compared weather condition result. 
  - The user is then presented with the output, fulfilling this goal.

#### Site Administrator Goals
  - **To give users the options to check current weather, weather forecasts and weather comparison result of 2 different locations / cities from the terminal.**

    - The user can access current weather, forecast weather and weather comparison result data via via Open Weather API.

  - **To give users the ability to navigate through options back and forth easily.**

    - The menu and sub-menu options allows the user to go back and forth and experience different sections of the app.

  - **To present data in more user friendly format as possible within the constraints of the terminal.**

    - The font format, menu options, display data with a break of 1-2 seconds and validating the user inputs are some of the measures in this regard.

    - **To create an application using Python with clean, resuable and commented code, utilising different functions and libraries.**

    - code has been broken into discrete files to try and group together code in an ordered manner that seeks to follow the flow of the program.
    - The code has been broken into discrete files to try and group together code in an ordered manner that seeks to follow the flow of the program.
    - The functions have been written in a way such that they are atomic and perform discrete operations. The fun.py file has many examples of function calls in order to create the end result.
    - Code is commented throughout to provide future proofing and all functions are annotated with a docstring.

  - **To handle any potential errors appropriately and consistently.**

    - Throughout the app there are multiple points where error handling is required. This is achieved through try/except in most cases along with if/else statements. 

  - **To keep security sensitive information hidden.**

    - The Open Weather API key is stored as an environment variable in Heroku project config vars and testing API key added to gitignore file.

<br><br>
<a href="#contents">BACK TO CONTENTS ðŸ”¼</a>

## Reminders

- Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
- Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
- Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.
